      Manual testing is performed by a human sitting in front of a computer, carefully executing the test steps.
      <strong>Automation testing means using an automation tool to execute your test case suite.</strong> The automation
      software can
      also enter test data into the system under test, compare expected and actual results, and generate detailed test
      reports. The goal of automation is to reduce the number of test cases to be run manually and not eliminate manual
      testing altogether.
    </p>

  <h2 class="title">Why automated testing? </h2>
  <div class="text_wrapper">
    <p>Automated-testing is essential due to the following reasons. Manual testing of all workflows, all fields all
      negative scenarios is time and cost consuming. It is difficult to test for multi-lingual sites manually.
      Automation does not require human intervention. You can run automated tests unattended or overnight. Automation
      increases the speed of test execution and test coverage. Manual testing can become tedious and hence error-prone.

    <div class="column">
      Test cases to be automated can be selected using the following criterion to increase the automation ROI (Return On Investment). 
      <ul>
      <li>Test cases that are executed repeatedly.</li>
      <li>Test cases that are very tedious or difficult to perform manually.</li>
      <li>Test cases that are time-consuming.</li>
      <li>High-risk business-critical test cases.</li>
    </ul>
       </div>
    <div class="column">
      The following categories of test cases are not suitable for automation. 
      <ul>
      <li>Test cases that are newly designed and not executed manually at least once.</li>
      <li>Test cases for which the requirements are frequently changing.</li>
      <li>Test cases that are performed on an ad-hoc basis.</li>
    </ul>
