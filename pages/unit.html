      Unit testing means looking at some small software module at a time and testing it in an isolated fashion. The main
      thing that distinguishes unit testing from other kinds of testing is that we're testing a smaller amount of
      software. Often the person performing the unit testing is the same person who implemented the module, and in that
      case, we may well be doing white box testing. But unit testing can also be black-box testing. (more on white and
      black box testing you can find <a href="methods.html">here</a>)</p>

    <h2 class="title">Goals of Unit Testing</h2>
    <div class="text_wrapper">

    <p>
      The goal of unit testing is to find defects in the software's internal logic
      under test as early as possible to create more robust software modules that we can compose later with other
      modules and end up with a system that works. Besides the size of the software under test, the other thing that
      distinguishes unit testing from different kinds of testing is that generally, at this level, we have no hypothesis
      about the patterns of usage of the software under test. In other words, we're going to try to test the unit with
      inputs from all different parts of its domain. Remember, the domain is the set of possible inputs for this piece
      of software. Unit testing is also a kind of testing that enjoys a great deal of good tool support, and... so
      Python has several frameworks for unit testing. It also has some frameworks for what are called mock objects, and
      what mock objects are is fake objects that we can bolt under the software under test that mock up the behaviour of
      the larger software system in which this unit lives.
