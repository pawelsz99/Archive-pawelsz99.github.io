      Compliance testing, also known as compliance testing, is a non-functional testing technique that checks whether a
      developed system meets the requirements of an organization's standards or not. In simple terms, it is a type of
      audit that is performed on the system to check whether all specified criteria are met or not. To ensure
      compliance, each organization sometimes appoints a Board of Regulators and Compliance Experts. This board checks
      whether development teams meet the standards of the organization or not. Standards typically used in the IT
      industry are generally defined by large organizations such as <a href="https://www.ieee.org/">IEEE (International
        Institute of Electrical and
        Electronics Engineers)</a> or <a href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C (World Wide Web Consortium)</a>.

    <ul>
      <li>Determining that the development and maintenance process is in line with the prescribed methodology.
      </li>
      <li>Ensuring that the products of each phase of development comply with the standards, procedures and guidelines.
      </li>
      <li>Evaluating the project documentation for completeness and validity
      </li>
    </ul>

  <h2 class="title">How to check compliance</h2>
  <div class="text_wrapper">
    Compatibility checks are quite simple. A set of standards and procedures is developed and documented for each phase
    of the development cycle. Compare the results of each stage with the standards and find the gaps. The team can do
    this through the inspection process, but I would recommend passing this to an independent team.
    Upon completion of the inspection, the author of each step should receive a list of non-compliant areas that require
    correction. The inspection process should be rerun after the activity elements have been developed to ensure that
    the non-conformance items have been approved and closed.
