    <p>
      Software testing methods are traditionally divided into white-box and black-box testing. These two approaches are
      used to describe the viewpoint the tester takes when designing test cases. A hybrid approach called grey-box
      testing can also be applied to software testing methodologies.

        <p>
          White box testing is the testing of software solutions internal coding and infrastructure. It focuses
          primarily on strengthening security, the flow of inputs and outputs through the application and improving
          design and usability. White box testing is also known as clear open structural and glass box testing.
          White box testing involves the testing of the software code for the following Internal security holes, Broken
          or poorly structured paths in the coding processes, The flow of specific inputs through the code, Expected
          output, The functionality of conditional loops, testing of each statement object and function on an individual
          basis. White box testing involves checking a series of predefined inputs against expected or desired outputs
          so that when a specific input does not result in the expected output, you have encountered a bug

      <h2 class="title">Black box testing</h2>
      <div class="text_wrapper">
        <p>
          Black box tests are also known as behavioural tests, opaque tests, closed-box tests, specification-based
          tests, or eye-to-eye tests.
          It is a software testing method that analyses the software's functionality, application without knowing the
          internal structure, design of the test item. It compares the input value with the output value.
          In black-box testing, the focus is on the functionality of the system as a whole. The term 'behavioural
          testing' is also used for black-box testing. The behavioural test design is slightly different from the black
          box test design as the use of internal code knowledge is not strictly prohibited but is still discouraged.
          Each testing method has its advantages and disadvantages. A few bugs cannot be found using only the black box
          technique or only the white box technique.

  <h2 class="title">Grey box testing</h2>
  <div class="text_wrapper">
    <p>
      Grey box testing is a software testing technique for testing software or an application with partial knowledge of
      the application's internal structure. The purpose of grey box testing is to find and identify defects resulting
      from poor code structure or misuse of the application.
      This process often identifies context-specific errors that are related to network systems. Increases the scope of
      testing by focusing on all layers of any complex system.
      Grey box testing is a software testing method that combines a white box test and a black box test.
