      Interface testing is defined as a type of software testing that checks that communication between two different
      software systems is working correctly. A connection that integrates two components is called an interface. In the
      world of computers, an interface can be anything, such as an API, web services, etc. Testing these links is called
      interface testing. An interface is actually software made up of sets of commands, messages, and other attributes
      that allow a device to communicate with each other and a user.

    <h2 class="title">Goals of Interface Testing</h2>
    <div class="text_wrapper">
    Interface testing for a couple of reasons:
    <ul>
      <li>Ensure that end users or the customer do not encounter any problems when using the specified software</li>
      <li>Identify which areas of the application are mostly used by the end-users and check their user-friendliness.</li>
      <li>Verification of security requirements during the communication between systems</li>
      <li>Test if the solution is able to deal with network failures between the application server and the website</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

      <div class="column">
        Interface Testing
        <ul>
        <li>Interface testing is carried out to test an interface to verify the expected result.</li>
        <li>Interface testing is tricky and boring.</li>
        <li>Interface testing is mostly automated.</li>
        <li>Interface testing is performed only on the code</li>
        <li>Interface testing is done on interfaces like APIs, web services, connection strings etc.</li>
      </ul>
         </div>
      <div class="column">
        Integration Testing
        <ul>
        <li>Integration testing is performed to verify the end-to-end functionality of the integrated components.</li>
        <li>Integration testing is easy but lengthy.</li>
        <li>Integration testing is manual and automation both.</li>
        <li>Integration testing is performed on both code and GUI of the application.</li>
        <li>Integration testing is done on integrated components.</li>
