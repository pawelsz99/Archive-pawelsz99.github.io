      System testing is the testing of a complete and fully integrated software product. Usually, the software is only
      one element of a larger computer-based system. Ultimately software is interfaced with other software and hardware
      systems. System testing is a series of different tests whose sole purpose is to exercise the full computer-based
      system.

  <h2 class="title">What do you verify in system testing?</h2>
  <div class="text_wrapper">
    <p>
      System testing involves testing the software code for the following: testing the fully integrated applications,
      including external peripherals, to check how components interact with one another and with the system as a whole.
      This is also called end-to-end scenario testing.
      Verify through testing of every input in the application to check for desired outputs.
      Testing of the users experience with the application.

  <h2 class="title">Types of system testing</h2>
  <div class="text_wrapper">
    <p>
      There are more than 50 types of system testing. a few types of system testing a large software development company
      would typically use are: usability testing, stress testing, regression testing, functional testing.

  <h2 class="title">What types of system testing should testers use?</h2>
  <div class="text_wrapper">
    <p>
      
      There are over 50 different types of system testing. The specific types used by a tester depend on several
      variables. Those variables include: who the tester works for, which is a significant factor in determining system
      testing types a tester will use. Methods used by large companies are different from those used by medium and small
      companies. Time available for testing -ultimately, all 50 testing types could be used. Time is often what limits
      us to using only the types that are most relevant to the software project resources available to the tester. Of
      course, some testers will not have the necessary resources to conduct a testing type. For example, if you are a
      tester working for a large software development firm, you will likely have expensive automated testing software
      not available to others. Software testers education - there is a certain learning curve for each type of software
      testing available. To use some of the software involved, a tester has to learn how to use it. Testing budget -
      money becomes a factor not just for smaller companies and individual software developers but large companies as
      well.
