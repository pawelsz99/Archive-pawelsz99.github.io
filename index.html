    <p><strong>Software testing</strong> is a process to identify the correctness
      completeness and quality of developed computer software. It includes a set
      of activities conducted with the intent of finding errors in software so
      that it could be corrected before the product is released to the end-users.
      <i>In simple words software testing is an activity to check that the software
        system is defect free.</i><br>

  <h2 class="title">Why is testing important?</h2>
  <div class="text_wrapper">
    <p >A software bug crashed the China Airlines Airbus a300 on April 26,
       1994, killing 264 innocent people. Software bugs can potentially 
       cause monetary, and human loss history is full of such examples. 
       In 1985 Canada's therac-25 radiation therapy machine malfunctioned 
       due to a software bug and delivered lethal radiation doses to patients 
       leaving three people dead and critically injuring three others. 
       In April of 1999, a software bug caused the failure of a 1.2 billion
        dollar military satellite launched the costless accident in history.
         In May of 1996, a software bug caused the bank accounts of 823 
         customers of a major US bank to be credited with 920 million 
         US dollars. As you see, testing is necessary because software
          bugs can be expensive or even dangerous.
